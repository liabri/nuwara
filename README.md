# nuwara

## abstract
Where would we be right now were we given a different sandbox to play in? The whole concept is based on real world evolutionary science with sprinkles of creative liberty, relying heavily on the butterfly effect to give shape to this new world. Before we discuss these changes, we need to first establish what has changed.

## motivation
Every single mind has wandered through different worlds, imagining what could be different, sparked by the curiosities of our current world. However much unknown there is left in this world, this curiosity leaks into creativity, afterall, what cannot be known will be guessed. This world will act as my mental playground, I will experiment with cultures, societies, languages, technologies, without the tangible constraints which pull us down here.
