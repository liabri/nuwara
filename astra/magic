Sentience in magic creatures ?


How did magic start ?

All intelligent life comes from the same genus: Lamino

The ability to manipulate an element is a geniological factor, in this world, at one point a species of lamino known as "Florensis" evolved to use these elements to aid in their development. This allowed to all the descendents of this species to be able to use "magic", it is estimated that the introduction of this evolutionary advantage came to light an odd 350,000 years ago. Unsurprisingly, around 75% of the population of the planet descendes from this species.

Originally the magic was solely of use in the creation of tools, the most basic form of the magic: Stone Manipulation (i just wrote this is the most basic form for now but ill think of a better one, maybe heat?)

Certain species will have the magic evolve just like their body, based on their surroundings and needs


What is magic ?
Magic is an evolutionary thingy which started simply with the manipulation of certain stones. It has then evolved much more complexly. 

Florensis developed a new endocrine gland which releases a substance which is able to interact with materials on a completely different plain. 
Florensis evolved the bone marrow which has led to the release of a certain substance into the blood stream which is able to interact with materials on a completely different plain.

How does this substance work ?
	It is able to interact with the specific discipline of the user on a different plane, maybe known as the fourth dimension. The third dimension is the shadow of the fourth dimension, the fourth dimension is pure plane, manipulation in the fourth plane is easy, and in that is shown in the third dimension

It is unlikely to use this ability without conscious thought as it requires a certain amount of focus to produce enough of Y to be able to manipulate anything. Some people are born with a condition which naturally produces too little or too much of Y, either requiring more or less work respectively. To be able to execute any form of magic, the user must use a mixture of body gestures and thought. The more skilled the user, the less of a need for body gestures to aid in the execution. the goal is to concentrate this substance into the relative part of the body, maybe certain parts of the body allow different types of manipulation, possibly making these "gestures" a form of martial arts. 

For example, to manipulate the shape of a stone, 
	a very unskilled user will need to physically hold the stone and attempt to squash it into shape, while imagining it being squashed.
	a skilled user will just need to think of the stone being squash into shape.


What are the main categories ?

There are 5 basic categories of manipulation which is generally dependent on the personality of the user. This power grows with the user, until the age of approximately 4 the child is categoriless, there is a test which can be taken to determine the category of the user.

Personality based is kinda stupid.

The categories are as follows :
	Enhancement
	Transmutation
	Emission
	Conjugation
	Manipulation
	Specialisation

A magic mod similar to Bewitchment but with a lighter take involving fairy magic. Would include a biome called the Faewood where you can find special trees, flowers, and other materials related to fairy magic. There would be things like an altar to leave offerings, ways to summon special fairy mobs that can do helpful things like grow your crops, grant blessings, etc. I am aware of how... girly this mod sounds and that's fully the point. I can help with the artistic side of the mod creation if anyone is willing to help me with the scripting.

My system treats magical energy as another type of energy, such as thermal or kinetic energy. In order to cast a spell, you convert magical energy into another type (or several types) of energy.

Magic abilities are passed down by genes. Mixing of disciplines makes a new discipline generally, but it is very rarely possible that the offspring will have both disciplines of the parents. Mixing disciplines of different attributes (generally different races) has the chance to produce an offspring of no discipline or very weak, but also if X could make an offspring that has both disciplines in excess strength.

~ Necromancy ~

Death is the effect of a vital part of your body failing. It can be a large part, like the heart, or many small parts like the cells of your brain.
Realistic, hard science necromancy would "repair" that damage. That is, you would rebuild damaged cells, using non-decomposed cells (and their DNA) as blueprints. In most parts of the body, exactly replicating the state before death would not be neccessary. You'd simply grow new skin and bones (if your patient had lost an arm), and the result would be a youthful body part without the traces of life such as scars and wrinkles.
But in the brain, you could only repair what was still there, not what was lost. If your patient's brain was complete and undecomposed, that person's memory and personality would still be there after reviving, as both are stored in the form of neuron cells and their connections. But if those neurons or their connections are partly gone, either because the brain was damaged (e.g. in an accident) or has begun to decompose, that part of the person or their memories or abilities would be gone.
Therefore, the longer a person would have been dead, the more of the original person would have been lost and remain lost forever. You could then either revive someone to a state of mental retardation, leaving the lost functioning unrestored, or artificially introduce abilities (such as speech) and knowledge (such as what money is). Artificially introducing abilities and knowledge would result in a functioning human organism with amnesia, that is with only partial or no personal memories. The extent of the amnesia would depend on the extent of the brain damage.
If such a repair were possible, we could not only restore the (recently) dead, but would also have immortality, as the technique could also be applied before death to prevent it.

If there are no human souls, but there are some kinds of ethereal creatures, spirits it daemons, they may be coaxed and bound into the human-shaped body - then you effectively may have no limit on reanimation time - a skeleton would serve as well, although it will not have the memories of the original inhabitant of a body (to access the memories you still would need 8-hour limit). In the second case a golem could serve about just as well as a real corpse, though.




Kinetic Energy

For necromancy, you would convert magical energy into kinetic energy, thusly moving the corpse. In this way, you are not really reviving the corpse in the sense of bringing it back to life, instead you are manipulating it, similar to a puppet master pulling its strings. It is far more accurate to call this reanimation rather than resurrection.

In order to prevent the corpse from decomposing, i use what i call “kinetic barriers”. These are areas of kinetic energy which act like a solid object. Essentially, any force put upon this barrier is resisted as the kinetic barrier pushes against the force put upon it, thusly cancelling it out. In terms of a corpse, the kinetic barrier covers its body and pushes away oxygen and pathogens, preventing the corpse from decomposing. This means that, as long as the spell lasts, the corpse will not decompose and will be able to move.

Electrical Energy

Due to how necromancy works in my world, it means you can’t bring someone back from the dead (unless using the chemical energy method described below). You could control their body but not bring them back to life.

Instead, to somewhat overcome this, i though of using electrical energy much like how a defibrillator is used. In this way, you could ‘revive’ someone by stopping their heart with electricity, allowing it to restart. Whilst this wouldnt work in all cases, it would in the case of a heart attack which could cause someone to ‘die’ (in reality, we know they’re not dead, just suffering from a heart attack. However, medieval people might not realise this and assume the person was brought back to life).

This method allows the revived person to remember most, if not all, of what they did before they ‘died’, prevents them from decomposing and makes sure their biology is exactly the same. However, it isn’t true necromancy, though people may see it as such.

Chemical Energy

This method is a lot harder to perform (and harder to describe accurately). Essentially, healing magic in my world works by converting magical energy into chemical energy and using that to accelerate the body’s natural healing processes.

Applying this to necromancy, you may be able to repair the damaged cells in the deceased’s body using chemical energy. This would cause any internal injuries to be healed and the body to be refilled with blood. In this case, it is perfectly reasonable to call this method resurrection as you are actually bringing someone who died back to life.

There are several issues with this method, though this plays perfectly into your question. Firstly, the body would need resources to repair itself, such as with proteins obtained from food. Second, if i remember correctly from my CPR training, it only takes around 3-5 minutes without oxygen to get brain damage. This would mean your mage needs to be relatively quick if they want to keep the subject’s memories perfectly intact. Otherwise they might have amnesia or partial amnesia. Finally, if the spell works, the person is no longer dead, they are as alive as they were before they died, meaning they still need to eat and breathe and perform every other bodily function the human body does.

Bonus - Where to get the bodies

When most people think of necromancy, they think of necromancers raising the corpses of deceased solider on a battlefield or raiding graveyards and crypts. However, there are so much more interesting things you could do.

For example, executions. A necromancer might go to a prison and ask the guard if there are any prisoners awaiting execution and, if so, may ask to buy the body. Obviously this would not work as well if they were beheaded, though if they were hung or poisoned you could easily reanimate the body. (Also, a guard may say ‘yes’ and execute a prisoner who wasn’t on the list to get a bit of extra money).

An alternative may be to go to a hospital morgue or a holy site, though they might be more reluctant to hand over the deceased. A thieves guild, mercenary guild or an assassins guild may quite readily hand over bodies though. You could also pay grave robbers to bring you bodies, much like what was done in Victorian London where scientists were dissecting human cadavers to find out how they worked, though this was highly illegal.

Another example would be contracts. Local peasantry or the homeless are famously short on money, something an enterprising necromancer may exploit. A necromancer may go to a local peasant and offer to buy their body once they die, paying them in advance. Whilst this might seem ludicrous and you may think no one would ever do this, you have to remember this peasant may have a large, starving family and no way of paying for or making food. This works especially well in times of famine or war or simply when taxes are raised significantly. (An evil necromancer may pay someone, have them sign the contract and kill them, this works best if if looks like an accident and does not happen immediately after they sign the contract. If the local law enforcement come, the necromancer has the contract proving that the victim’s body belongs to them.)

When someone comes along with a bag of coin offering to buy their body, which they wont be using once they die anyway, it may seem a tempting offer. Its a similar idea to how people donate their bodies to science in our modern world. You have even have this on a larger scale with magical academies making these offers and giving the bodies to their necromancy students.


~ Pyromancy ~

AKA moving heat around or creating it

    Light a Campfire
    light your way in a cave (heat some metal to have it glow and give light that way)
    Fireballs (Though you might need a delivery mechanism... heat up a ball of air and throw that. Should give an explosion after sufficient compression. But that requires Aeromancy - so we have to be creative! Bonus!)
    Freeze water (by pulling heat away)

~ Aeromancy/Anemoscopy ~

AKA moving air around

    Wind
    "Kinetic punch" (invisible fist type attacks, which are really some compressed air you're moving around)
    your vacuum choking bubble
    Push air against their windpipe (Darth Vader choke)
    Personal flight (perhaps all dragons use this to get around that pesky cube-square law. Just have wind strong enough to move you upwards under you. Ofc, this would be far more efficient with wings...)

And so on. Then for the cost, you can make it dependent on the amount you need to move around. For example, rules like:

    Moving air gets harder the less air there is, so for example halving air pressure always takes the same amount of magic. Now your villain has to choose between killing that risky hero sooner, or expending more magic. After all, taking away 80% of the air will kill the hero, but taking away 90% will kill him slightly faster. But it's double the magic.
    Heat creation is more expensive than transport, so even fire mages can be in trouble in the arctic.

~~~~~ Cost ~~~~~

1. You can rate spells for intensity, size, duration, number, and range, and let the cost be the sum or product of these numbers.

Intensity:

    Minor (create dim light, change temperature +/- 10 C, create a breeze, lift an object, cosmetically change something, dispel a minor effect, etc.)
    Moderate (lightly damage something, create fire, cold or intense light, hurl an object, moderately change something, dispel a moderate effect, etc.,)
    Major (severely damage something, create intense fire or cold, create dead object, majorly change something, teleport an object, dispel a major effect, etc.)
    Huge (e.g. destroy or disintegrate something, create living being, totally transform something, dispel a huge effect, etc.)

+1: Cannot be dispelled.

Size

    Small (< 5 kg or affecting area a few centimeters across)
    Medium (5-50 kg or affecting area a few meters across)
    Large (50-500 kg or affecting area a few hundred meters across)
    Huge (500-5,000 kg or affecting area some tens of kilometers across)
    Vast (more than 5,000 kg or affecting a large country)

Duration

    Brief (less than a minute)
    Short (less than an hour)
    Moderate (a few days)
    Long (less than a year)
    Indefinite (until dispelled or naturally eroded)

Note: Wounds (damage) last until naturally healed; destruction/disintegration is forever.

Number

    A single target/object within range
    Up to 4 separate targets/objects within range
    Up to 15 separate targets/objects within range
    Up to 60 separate targets/objects within range
    Up to 250 separate targets/objects within range

Range

2. Use physics

1. has the right idea, but (as Michael notes) makes the same mistake I (initially) made when designing my own magic system; forgetting that Work != Force.
Work

Start with Kain0_0's answer. For anything that does Work, you can calculate the cost in Watts or Watt-Hours. (The former is more useful if you minimize Magic's

This works for magical effects that can be reduced to energy changes; moving things, increasing or decreasing heat, chemical changes (breaking or creating chemical bonds), or many electrical or electromagnetic effects.
Force

If magic allows you to exert force, and it sounds like you want that, you probably want that to also cost something. Otherwise, things like keeping all the atmosphere out of a room, or hovering, become effortless, which leads to all sorts of world-breaking abilities. (Pushed out of an airplane? Need to lift an ocean liner? No problem; just cancel gravity, it's free!)

I asked about this (How can I meaningfully define the energy cost of magical levitation?) but haven't received any satisfactory answers. I ended up just making up a number for this cost, but I don't have any explanation for it. That being the case, I suppose you could use whatever number achieves the level of "oomph" you want your magic to have.
Distance

One way in which I limited my magic was by adding a distance based "falloff cost". In my case, I went with an arbitrary and excessive curve. (I haven't pegged it to an exact formula, but it probably has an exponent of 3-5 or more.) You can easily specify that the efficiency of magic is somehow a function of the distance between the magic user and where the effect is happening. Both linear and inverse square falloff have strong foundations in real physics, but you can use whatever you like (it is magic after all), or omit this entirely.
Cost

Now that you have a means to calculate the cost of any particular bit of magic, how do you "pay" for it? Does the energy come from the user's metabolism? (This is how my system works, also many others including the magic in Eragon.) If you go this route, How much can a magician lift if constrained by her own body's energy?, Magic and physics with human power output and How can wizards do such powerful things running on pure human metabolism? may be useful. Can the user "store up" energy somehow, or is their power limited to real-time metabolism?

You mentioned using blood... does magic extract energy from that according to    
, or does it just allow you to channel energy from somewhere else? You don't give enough information to answer this, so you can probably make up whatever conversion rate you want.

3. The differentiation you mention reminds me of the difference between Li and Jin in martial arts. I'll gloss them here, but I highly recommend the work of others to really understand the terms.

Li is brute force, like creating gigantic fireballs or moving heavy objects. It's character is 力, which fittingly looks quite a lot like a plow being drug through the earth. As you have noticed, this is easy to quantify and assign limits to.

Jin, 勁, is a bit more tricky. It captures the concept of skillful power. The character shows the idea of passes through, or under, like a river underneath a city. Me lifting a rock may be Li, but an Olympic grade deadlifter can only achieve those great lifts by power that goes through all limits of the human body that we thought possible, and empowers the lift with an energy that makes us all stand in awe.

And key to understanding how to balance these powers is the little I shaped symbol in the corner, Gong, 工. The Chinese meaning of this word is somewhat along the lines of "work." The first word of "kung fu" is this symbol (for phonetic reasons, sometimes it's written gong, other times it's written kung. But it's the same word). It's the concept of work and gains which comes from doing work.

Which brings to the test I recommend. Develop a sense not of how much power a particular spell has, but a sense of how much work has to be spent to develop a control over it. How many years did the villian spend practicing his skills at vacuum manipulation before the hero appeared. (Likewise, how many years did your dread pirate spend developing an immunity to iocane powder)

Finally, consider that anyone who develops this sort of skill through work is not going to waste it. If they have a particular power like this, they will want to use it for more than just a one-shot at the hero's head. They'll want to work it into their life. What does that look like? That tells you the shape of this gong fu. Don't focus on the brute force skill of pumping a vacuum. Concentrate on what flows through their life. Perhaps this means they focused on controlling winds around them. The vacuum is just an ultimate manifestation of winds pushing away from a point. How would they use that wind control in every day life? How would they not waste all that effort they spent learning it.

Then, use the rule of cool in the inverse. Is a character who acts this way "too cool" for the story? You'll get a sense of believability rather quickly.

And then you can also map this to how convenient circumstances are, and how little has to be done. Gandalf from Lord of the Rings is an excellent example of this. We get a sense of just how extraordinarily powerful he is, but he chooses to exhibit his skills only in the way which takes advantage of circumstances to decrease how much Jin, how much skilled power he must demonstrate.
