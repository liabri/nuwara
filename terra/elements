~~~~~~~~~~~ Metals ~~~~~~~~~~~

Luss, a material that creates or destroys matter at random. Tools made from the stuff result in highly variable drops from both blocks and entities, and direct application of the raw material to valuables results in an explosion of resources... or a fissile. Be warned that fortune does not favor those who would preserve these tools indefinitely, though with cunning its methods can be turned to your favor. Seek this material in the stone above glowstone growths.

 
Vuld, a ravenous substance that consumes everything it touches. Should you coat diamonds in this, the resulting tools will destroy your foes utterly. Not even dust will remain. The ultimate in performance, vuld will hit harder, mine faster, and last longer than most anything else! It you want power at any cost, claim it from the withered bones of it's past victims.

 
Batet, a devil's bargain in crystal form. Armor made from it prevents all harm, but incurs a blood debt that will be collected over several seconds. Weapons and tools made of batet drink in the destruction they cause, paying off any debts you have incurred. If you want a chance to recover before the reaper catches up, seek dark crystals in the lava sea.

 

This mod adds 3 new materials which can be forged into 3 sets of tools/weapons, 2 sets of armor, and 6 usable items and consumables each with unique effects.

X, a ravenous substance that consumes everything it touches. Created through the combined efforts of a necromancer and (someone who manipulates spatial things), very hard to procure. To even wield such a sword drains the user exponentially, even potentially to death. Small specks of it is generally put on blades or tools which exponentially increase the effectiveness of it (or built into an alloy), but as it is so destructive (essentially removing the existence of whatever it touches (only to a certain degree, it would take prolonged exposure to completely remove the existence of an item, unless it is pure)), it is not used to on valuable materials to ensure that nothing is destroyed.

Y, seen as a bargain with the devil in the form of metal, known for its such in Armour as it prevents all harm, but incurs a debt of the wielders life, depending on the strength of the hit, the life of the user will be shortened. It is possible to recover before the reaper catches up, but it is a fairy tale*

*that fairy tale is quite good, and that is actually not a fairy tale: one day, a silly goose met a silly calf, they became mice friends, they end up sharing music, then they had sex (literslly after it, yes, that the truth, like they share music and poof, they have sex, *BAM*), and then they decided they were in a r-, and now thye are happy poos together** even tho sometimes the silly calf is eating too much chorizo and the silly goose is being kinda silly***

**I LIKE YOU

***the silly goose request more kisses and cuddles cause she is very close from death and she will die if the baby calf doesnt kiss her rn :( ~~(she is totally not affectionnally dependent of the baby calf)
